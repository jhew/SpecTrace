# SpecTrace Privacy Policy

*Last updated: September 2025*

## Overview

SpecTrace is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle. This policy explains how SpecTrace handles your information.

## Data Collection

**SpecTrace does NOT collect, transmit, or store any personal data remotely.**

### What SpecTrace Accesses Locally
SpecTrace reads system information from your computer including:
- Hardware specifications (CPU, memory, graphics, storage)
- System configuration details
- Network adapter information
- Security feature status
- Performance metrics

### What SpecTrace Does NOT Do
- ❌ Send any data to external servers
- ❌ Connect to the internet
- ❌ Install tracking software
- ❌ Access personal files or documents
- ❌ Monitor user behavior
- ❌ Store data in the cloud
- ❌ Share information with third parties

## Local Data Handling

### Information Processing
- All system information is processed locally on your device
- Data is displayed in the application interface
- Information can be exported to files at your discretion
- No data is transmitted outside your computer

### PII Redaction Feature
SpecTrace includes a "Redact PII" option that can hide:
- Computer hostnames
- Serial numbers
- MAC addresses
- Volume labels
- IP addresses

This feature helps protect personally identifiable information when sharing system reports.

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only
- SpecTrace does not create permanent data files unless you explicitly export them
- No configuration data is stored in registries or hidden folders
- The application runs portably without installation
- All data remains under your complete control

### Exported Files
When you choose to export system information:
- Files are saved only to locations you specify
- You control what information is included
- You decide who to share exported files with
- Use the redaction feature before sharing if privacy is a concern

## Third-Party Components

SpecTrace uses standard Windows APIs and .NET Framework components:
- Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
- Setup API
- Registry access (read-only)
- Hardware detection APIs

These components operate locally and do not transmit data externally.

## Security

### Application Security
- Read-only operations - SpecTrace never modifies your system
- No elevated privileges required for basic functionality
- Timeout protection prevents system hangs
- Graceful error handling prevents crashes

### Source Code Transparency
SpecTrace is open source, allowing you to:
- Verify what the application does
- Audit the code for privacy compliance
- Build from source if desired
- Contribute to improvements

## Your Rights and Control

You have complete control over:
- ✅ When to run the application
- ✅ What information to view
- ✅ Whether to export data
- ✅ What information to include in exports
- ✅ Whether to redact sensitive information
- ✅ Who to share exported files with

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this privacy policy:
- Changes will be documented in the project repository
- Major changes will be highlighted in release notes
- The "Last updated" date will be modified

## Compliance

This privacy policy reflects SpecTrace's commitment to:
- **GDPR compliance** through data minimization and local processing
- **User privacy** through no-data-collection design
- **Transparency** through open source development
- **User control** through optional features and local-only operation

---

**Summary: SpecTrace is designed to be completely private. All your system information stays on your computer unless you explicitly choose to export and share it.**
